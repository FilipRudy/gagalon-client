## Description

This project is one of my freelance works, where Gagalon, a liquor store chain with 8 shops across the Silesian Voivodeship in Poland, reached out to me to create their homepage. It was a bit different from other landing pages I’ve created, as the client requested a specific design that didn't align with my initial vision of a more modern look. After a meeting, I gained a better understanding of their needs and, though it was a tough call, I adjusted the design to match their style. This included incorporating an image as the page background - one of the changes I wasn’t particularly fond of, but as they say, "The customer is king".
